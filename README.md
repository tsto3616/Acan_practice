# Acan_practice
This is my practice run of the Ancylostoma caninum genome. 

# A. caninum contig 91, nucleotide 1 to 693,006. 
Because this contig was downloaded from wormbase, as a fasta file, this meant that the fastQC, trimming, assembly and decontamination. Instead jumping straight into the annotation pipeline. This is the pipeline for nuclear genome annotation. The remaining annotation will be carried out once the assembly of the entire A. caninum genme is complete.

# Softmasking
This will be carried out through ReoeatMasker. This should be interesting as this contig contains Beta tubulin isotype 1... tubulins often get classified as repeats by softwares since they are highly conserved and duplicates etc. 

# DNA annotation 
This will be the real challenge, using BRAKER which combines ab initio prediction with transcriptomics, and many other avenues to get a full picture and serve as the comprehensive annotation software to annotate the DNA of soem of contig 91... not sure if this is the entire contig of 91, but it definitely includes the beta tubulin isotype 1 gene so it should be enough to work with!
